V2.0 

01. I can choose to play the Arcade Mode with a story, maps and objectives do accomplish.

#### 03. PROTOTYPING

The Peeps talked a lot about prototyping and design tools. It was agreed that each one can choose the best tool for himself/herself.

It was agreed that we should use [google material design](https://material.io/) to standardize and apply best practices on our app design.

@wydtron started to make his first prototypes and showed up FIGMA tool which is simples clean to use and allows us to work in group, on-line, in real time.

Next meeting will be on the 8th September cause the Peeps need some time to prepare prototypes. We also need an office to meet up.
