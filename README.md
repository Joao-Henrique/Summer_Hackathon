# Summer_Hackathon


### freeCodeCamp Faro
#### Hackathon to build a React-Native Game


#### 01. INTRO

Hi Peeps! 

Summer is here and cool stuff pops out of the box! It's time to drink some beers and improve our friendship and cohesion as a group! It's also time to improve our skills and go furthermore! 

# TOGETHER!


#### 02. THE IDEA

FCC Students are in different stages of learning how to program. In spite of that I think we could gather skills and develop a Native-React App / Game from Scratch.

The main objective would be to create a Game, available on computer and mobile devices. It would be a standard quizz game for programmers. Each question would appear to the user with four different answers: A,B,C,D. 

To accomplish this objective the FCC Faro community would have two types of efforts.

1. Participate in the face-to-face mettings
2. Participate alone or in groups at home working and doing PR to this GitHub repo.

The structure of this hackathon could be divided in the following topics:

1. Beer + Fun Meeting to define the user story of the game;
    
2. Work at home to improve the main user story defined before;

3. UI/UX Tournament (Definition of the Mockups and Functionality of the App)

This tournament would start at the home/office where each participant / team would PR proposals to the GH Repo. Then we would do a meeting to vote and decide which was the best design

4. Work at home to improve the winning UI/UX mockup.

5. Beer + Fun Meeting to define Front-End and Back-End requirements

6. Work at home to improve the FE and BE parts.

7. Beer + Fun Meeting to fine tune the FE and BE parts.

8. Beer + Fun Meeting for Preparing the App to be published in Apple and Google Stores

9. Work at home to accomplish with the preps.

8. Beer + Meeting / Party to celebrate and do the App launch and discuss the event to future improvement.
