#### 03. USER STORIES

The Peeps threw up a lot of ideas. All of them great and some of them toom much ambitious for our first app. I'll try to resume and define V1.0 and a later V2.0 (things to do after the first version is launched in the stores)

V1.0

01. When I open the app I can log in into the game (i can use Facebook Login or Sign-Up for an account if I don't want to use Facebook).

02. The game will present me with a fancy Dashboard where I can see/select: Settings, Leaderboard, Log out, Start Game (Game Modes).

03. The Dashboard will show me my statz: scores, time played, % of right answers, Mean Response Time, max no. of right answers in a row.

04. I can view a statz leaderboard and check this info for the last 30 days, present year or all time.

05. The Game will have a website to present the game and its mobile versions.

06. On the website you can also Sign-In/Sign-up and check stats. 

07. Game Modes: More questions answered in a minute, 20 correct answers, 100 correct answers.

08. The Player can ask for an Hint with score handicap.

09. The Player will have levels accordingly to His/Hers good results / stats.

10. The Game will have programming questions divided by subjects: javascript, databases, hardware, general computer science, etc.

V2.0 

01. I can choose to play the Arcade Mode with a story, maps and objectives do accomplish.

02. Develop a One-on-one game mode and a Cooperative Mode.
